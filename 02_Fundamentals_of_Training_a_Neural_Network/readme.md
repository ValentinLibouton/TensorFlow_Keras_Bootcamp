## Quiz
1. Suppose there are 5 classes in-order: Lion, Tiger, Elephant, Cheetah, and Leopard. Which of the following represents the correct one-hot encoded representation for Elephant and Leopard?
- [ ] [0,0,1,0,0] and [0,0,1,0,1]
- [ ] [1,0,1,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,1]
- [x] [0,0,1,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,1]
- [ ] [0,0,1,0,1] and [0,0,1,0,1]

2. Select the correct **SSE loss equation** for the following prediction vector: $\hat{y} = [0.10, 0.005, 0.40, 0.10, 0.35]$ and target vector: $y = [0,1,0,1,1]$
- [ ] $(0 - 0.10) + (1 - 0.05) + (0 - 0.40) + (1- 0.10) + (1 - 0.35)$
